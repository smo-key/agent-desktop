// PURE selection cores for the inbox overview (design 2026-06-04). The focus pane
// shows ONE agent: the user's explicit selection if any, else the first agent that
// needs attention, else none ("All clear"). Addressing the focused attention agent
// (it transitions out of the attention status) advances the focus to the next in
// the queue. Framework-free so it is trivially unit-tested; Inbox.svelte is the
// thin reactive shell that feeds it the live roster and renders the result.
