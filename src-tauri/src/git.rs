//! Per-PROJECT git status for the project pane.
//!
//! The footer's git pills ride the statusline snapshot of a RUNNING agent's pane.
//! The project pane, by contrast, wants each project's branch/ahead/behind/dirty
//! even when no agent is running in it — so this module shells out to `git`
//! directly against each project FOLDER. It mirrors the statusline wrapper's git
//! logic (`resources/statusline-wrapper.cjs`): branch via `rev-parse`, dirty via
//! `status --porcelain`, `ahead`/`behind` vs the branch's own upstream.
//! Every field is null when git can't answer (off-repo / no remote / no upstream),
//! so the shape is always stable and the call never fails the UI.
//!
//! Each requested path is probed on its own thread so total latency tracks the
//! slowest single repo rather than their sum; the frontend POLLS the
//! [`git_status_for`] command on a slow clock.
